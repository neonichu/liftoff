# Liftoff

This is my version of [liftoff][1]. It does some things differently than the original:

* Leave indentation settings alone, tabs are great!
* Treat warnings as errors for debug builds, too.

* Put default images into a Resources group and corresponding folder.
* Move the Support Files group up one level.
* Remove the unnecessary default lproj.
* Sort all groups alphabetically.
* Set the deployment target to iOS 5.1.
* Stage all the changes to Git.
